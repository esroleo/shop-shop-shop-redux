Create a custom provider

Having this all bundled up will make it easier to

The value prop is good to have included, as it opens us
up to pass in more data for state if we need to. 
We don't actually need to in this app, but it makes 
this provider flexible. The other prop, or rather 
...props, is in place to handle any other props the
user may need. Namely, we'll need to use props.children,
as this <StoreProvider> component will wrap all of our
other components, making them children of it. If we didn't
include {...props} in our returning <Provider> component,
nothing on the page would be rendered!
